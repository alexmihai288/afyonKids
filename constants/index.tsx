        In our AKD Kids institutions, English is included in the full-time
        education program. The program is specific to our institutions and is a
        foreign language education program prepared with our expert staff whose
        native language is English. Children learn English as a mother language,
        realizing that they need to speak a different language to communicate
        with their teacher. Our workbooks, which are designed in accordance with
        the age groups within our language education, are designed only for our
        institutions and have been created with an educational approach that
        meets European standards.
