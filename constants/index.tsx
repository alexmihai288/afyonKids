        In our AKD Kids institutions, English is included in the full-time
        education program. The program is specific to our institutions and is a
        foreign language education program prepared with our expert staff whose
        native language is English. Children learn English as a mother language,
        realizing that they need to speak a different language to communicate
        with their teacher. Our workbooks, which are designed in accordance with
        the age groups within our language education, are designed only for our
        institutions and have been created with an educational approach that
        meets European standards.

        The European Language Portfolio (ELP), in essence, is a personal file
        where individuals can follow their language learning processes and
        evaluate themselves. ELP is registered in the name of selected
        institution with the approval of the Council of Europe. The active ELP
        we use in our institutions is registered in the European Council
        database with the number 2012.R0006 on behalf of American Culture.
        American Culture is the only organization in Turkey that has a portfolio
        approved by the Council of Europe. American Culture is an institution
        that has established the principles of the European Language Portfolio
        in its courses and pre-school education institutions since 2004 and has
        been able to integrate it into its foreign language education.
        Accordingly, teachers guide our children during and after the initiation
        and evaluation of the European Language Portfolio.

        We cannot think of children independent of family education on this path
        we proceed with the understanding that education as a whole. For this
        reason, we prepare two bulletins, one in English and one in Turkish,
        with our experts for our parents every month. In this bulletin, there
        are monthly, weekly and daily programs for children, the music they
        learn and QR codes, the English words we learn, examples of activities
        that can be done with the family in parallel with the school, and family
        and child education recommendations.
